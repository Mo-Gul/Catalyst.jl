### Stability Analysis ###

    stability(u::Vector{T}, rs::ReactionSystem, p; tol = 10*sqrt(eps())
                ss_jac = steady_state_jac(u, rs, p))

Compute the stability of a steady state (Returned as a `Bool`, with `true` indicating stability).

Arguments:
- `u`: The steady state for which we want to compute stability.
- `rs`: The `ReactionSystem` model for which we want to compute stability.
- `p`: The parameter set for which we want to compute stability.
- `tol = 10*sqrt(eps())`: The tolerance used for determining whether computed eigenvalues real 
parts can reliably be considered negative/positive. In practise, a steady state is considered 
stable if the corresponding Jacobian's maximum eigenvalue real part is < 0. However, if this maximum 
eigenvalue is in the range `-tol< eig < tol`, and error is throw, as we do not deem that stability
can be ensured with enough certainty. The choice `tol = 10*sqrt(eps())` has *not* been subject
to much analysis.
- `ss_jac = steady_state_jac(u, rs)`: It is possible to pre-compute the 
Jacobian used for stability computation using `steady_state_jac`. If stability is computed 
for many states, precomputing the Jacobian may speed up evaluation.

Example:
```julia
# Creates model.
rn = @reaction_network begin
    (p,d), 0 <--> X
end
p = [:p => 1.0, :d => 0.5]

# Finds (the trivial) steady state, and computes its stability.
steady_state = [2.0]
steady_state_stability(steady_state, rn, p)

Notes:
- The input `u` can (currently) be both a vector of values (like `[1.0, 2.0]`) and a vector map 
(like `[X => 1.0, Y => 2.0]`). The reason is that most methods for computing stability only
produces vectors of values. However, if possible, it is recommended to work with values on the
form of maps.
- Catalyst currently computes steady state stabilities using the naive approach of checking whether
a system's largest eigenvalue real part is negative. While more advanced stability computation 
methods exist (and would be a welcome addition to Catalyst), there is no direct plans to implement 
these. Furthermore, Catalyst uses a tolerance `tol = 10*sqrt(eps())` to determine whether a 
computed eigenvalue is far away enough from 0 to be reliably used. This selected threshold can be changed through the `tol` argument.

"""
    steady_state_jac(rs::ReactionSystem; u0 = [])

Creates the Jacobian function which can be used as input to `steady_state_stability`. Useful when 
a large number of stability computation has to be carried out in a performant manner.

Arguments:
    - `rs`: The reaction system model for which we want to compute stability.
    - `u0 = []`: For systems with conservation laws, a `u` is required to compute the conserved quantities.
 
Example:
```julia
# Creates model.
rn = @reaction_network begin
    (p,d), 0 <--> X
end
p = [:p => 1.0, :d => 0.5]

# Creates the steady state jacobian.

# Finds (the trivial) steady state, and computes stability.
steady_state = [2.0]

Notes:
    - In practise, this function returns an `ODEProblem` (with a computed Jacobian) set up in 
    such a way that it can be used by the `steady_state_stability` function.
